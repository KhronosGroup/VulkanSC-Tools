# KhronosGroup/VulkanSC-Tools

This project provides Vulkan SC tools and utilities that can assist development by enabling developers to verify their applications correct use of the Vulkan SC API.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This repository is to be used with the [Vulkan SC](https://www.khronos.org/vulkansc/) API and should not be confused with the similar repository that exists for the Vulkan API (see https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools). While it is possible to build the Vulkan version from this repository, this repository contains a forked version of the upstream code and may not be up-to-date with the latest changes in the upstream repository.

## Intro

The following components are available in this repository:

- [*Mock ICD*](icd/)
- [*Vkcube and Vkcube++ Demo*](cube/)
- [*VulkanInfo*](vulkaninfo/)
- [*Windows Runtime*](windows-runtime-installer/)

## How to Build and Run

[BUILD.md](BUILD.md) includes directions for building all components as well as running the vkcube demo applications.

## Version Tagging Scheme

Updates to the `VulkanSC-Tools` repository which correspond to a new Vulkan specification release are tagged using the following format: `v<`_`version`_`>` (e.g., `v1.1.96`).

**Note**: Marked version releases have undergone thorough testing but do not imply the same quality level as SDK tags. SDK tags follow the `sdk-<`_`version`_`>.<`_`patch`_`>` format (e.g., `sdk-1.1.92.0`).

This scheme was adopted following the 1.1.96 Vulkan specification release.


For Vulkan SC, updates to a new API version will be tagged using the following format `vksc<`_`version`_`>.<`_`patch`_`>` (e.g., `vksc1.0.12`).
